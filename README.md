## Project Name

Pokedex

## Project Description

I am recreating a Pokedex which is a digital encyclopedia of Pokemon from it's database. The Pokedex will be fully functional like the one on the show displaying a visual of the Pokemon and it's data on one side and a list index of selectable Pokemon with buttons on the other side. You can read more about the Pokedex here: <https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9dex>

## API and Data Sample

I'm using the world's most used Pokemon API which averages a million calls a month. https://pokeapi.co/

```json
{
    "abilities": [
        {
            "ability": {
                "name": "overgrow",
                "url": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/65/"
            },
            "is_hidden": false,
            "slot": 1
        },
        {
            "ability": {
                "name": "chlorophyll",
                "url": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/34/"
            },
            "is_hidden": true,
            "slot": 3
        }
    ],
    "base_experience": 64,
    "forms": [
        {
            "name": "bulbasaur",
            "url": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-form/1/"
        }
```

## Wireframes

Wireframe link here: https://wireframe.cc/Wuc80r

Showing overall layout of my Pokedex with the left container showing a picture of the Pokemon with it's coresponding data. The right container will have a selectable list of Pokemon in order to choose from with buttons to navigate between pages. This container will also have a search field to directly look up Pokemon.

#### MVP 

- Properly display Pokemon image with it's corresponding data features once selected or searched for 
- Mimic replica look of a Pokedex
- Ensure all buttons are functional 

#### PostMVP  

- Add more dynamic media of Pokemon not included in this API
- Add an intro animation that opens up Pokedex when first loaded
